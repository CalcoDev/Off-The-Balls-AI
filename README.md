## Off The Balls AI
This is just a fun project I worked on, in order to improve my knowledge of neural networks and machine learning. </br>

## Description
This is the source code for an artifical neural network aimed towards predicting the angle an agent has to aim at, in order to hit a ball. </br>
Currently I have yet to recreate the game, and the AI has yet to be tested in Dani's game.
